  abstract={Education on modern Korean economic development history, which helps to learn various economic concepts empirically in historical context and foster decision-making skills, is not being taken actively in Korean secondary education. We developed three PBL programs, which consist of important events in the Korean contemporary economic development history, and carried out a pilot class. In addition, we also developed reading materials so that teachers and students could study advanced contents in depth. As a result of the pilot class carried out with students at the College of Education on Living History of Heavy and Chemical Industries, a high level of satisfaction was obtained regarding the adequacy, practicality, knowledge acquisition, interest, and intention to use the program. The satisfaction of students who plan to be teachers and those who do not plan to be teachers showed no statistical differences. This implies that the program is satisfactory not only for teachers but also for general audience. Our PBL programs for Korean economic history, which have not been existed, could be actively used in real classrooms.},

  title={Time Preference and Economic Decision Making in Aging: Focusing on Implications for Economics Education},

  year={2017},
  abstract={This study focuses on older adults who are over 60 years old and investigates the relationship between time preferences and some related variables to understand the characteristics of elderly people's economic decision making. We investigate the time preferences of 73 elderly men and women living in Seoul by using the rate of time discount suggested by behavioral economics. The rate of time discounted is well known as an important explanatory variable that indicates an individual's impulsiveness, self-control, and present orientation. We discovered that older adults' average rate of time discount was lower than that of young adults, and this result was statistically significant. This result implies that aged people are less likely to be impulsive and more likely to show higher self-control. We also found that those who identify with the aged group and think that their remaining life is relatively shorter show higher rates of time discount than those who consider themselves still ‘not old enough’. In addition, older adults with disability also tended to show higher rates of time discount. This implies that lifelong economics education is needed to promote the ability of economic decision making with longer term perspective.},
